					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>My personality has always been ambitious, driven, and goal oriented. As a former athlete, playing
					both semi-pro baseball and golf, former professional musician, former personal trainer and strength
					coach, former music industry professional, and now software engineer, I know the meaning of
					discipline, but I also know I love learning!
					Previous to software engineering, my career in the music business started as a project manager, and
					ended up leading me to become a data analyst in Income Tracking Analytics.
					In that role, I worked regularly with large data in Hadoop using software like Tableau, and
					open-source SQL engines like Apache Hive and Impala, and later Google Cloud. I was also exposed to
					utilizing the underlying platform services and infrastructure using
					Kubernetes, wrote scripts to fetch data from various API's, and worked with developers to build
					tools for process automation and business forecasting.</p>

				<p>It was during this role that I started to teach myself programming, and immediately fell in love with
					it. So much so, that I went all in and decided to attend a bootcamp called <a
						href"http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" alt="NSS Link">Nashville Software School</a>. My focus
					there included Javascript, Node.js, and Python.
					This was a fairly substantial career shift, but one I am happy I made as I get to solve problems
					everyday, learn everyday, and keep my search for a challenge always satisfied!</p>
				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy being active, going to the gym, being involved in the community as well as
					going to conferences, and anything that involves learning something new or challenging myself. I
					also really enjoy mentoring new students and helping people bring out the best in themselves.</p>

				<h3>Volunteer Work</h3>
				<p>PyTennessee 2020</p>
				<p>PyTn is hosted at Nashville School of Law and is is a yearly regional Python conference that is a
					developer-focused Python conference with talk topics running the gamut between beginner and
					advanced, and from web development to data science and machine learning. I was responsible for
					possibly the most important part of the conference--giving the speakers the help they needed and
					keeping the conference moving smoothly. I participated in helping in set-up, tear down, checking
					guests in, and moving items as necessary.</p>
				<p>Music City Code 2019</p>
				<p>The Music City Tech conference is held at Nossi College of Art in Nashville, TN and is a conference
					that caters to developers and touches on all aspects of software and website development. The
					Conference is focused on quality over quantity, with three sub-conferences: Music City Code, Music
					City Agile, and Music City Data. As a volunteer, I was responsible for set-up before the conference
					and checking guests in, as well as catering to the speakers, making sure they had what they needed
					for their talks, getting them set up for their talks, as well as any duty necessary to make sure the
					conference ran as smoothly as possible.</p>
