					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Previous to software engineering, I had a career in the music business as a data analyst. I gained
					experience working in a rapidly changing and demanding environment, where my role touched nearly
					every other department in the company. My responsibilities in redirection, live performance
					tracking, mechanical tracking, radio tracking, pipeline analysis and forecasting would contribute to
					over $5 million dollars recovered annually. In addition, I worked regularly with large data in
					Hadoop, and later Google Cloud, utilized the underlying platform services and infrastructure with
					Kubernetes, wrote scripts to fetch data using various API's, and worked directly with our developers
					to build tools, apps, and automate processes.</p>

				<p>PyTennessee 2020</p>
				<p>PyTn is hosted at Nashville School of Law and is is a yearly regional Python conference that is a
					developer-focused Python conference with talk topics running the gamut between beginner and
					advanced, and from web development to data science and machine learning. I was responsible for
					possibly the most important part of the conference--giving the speakers the help they needed and
					keeping the conference moving smoothly. I participated in helping in set-up, tear down, checking
					guests in, and moving items as necessary.</p>
				<p>Music City Code 2019</p>
				<p>The Music City Tech conference is held at Nossi College of Art in Nashville, TN and is a conference
					that caters to developers and touches on all aspects of software and website development. The
					Conference is focused on quality over quantity, with three sub-conferences: Music City Code, Music
					City Agile, and Music City Data. As a volunteer, I was responsible for set-up before the conference
					and checking guests in, as well as catering to the speakers, making sure they had what they needed
					for their talks, getting them set up for their talks, as well as any duty necessary to make sure the
					conference ran as smoothly as possible.</p>
