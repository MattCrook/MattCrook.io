					<h2>About</h2>
				</header>
				<p>My personality has always been ambitious, driven, and goal oriented. As a former athlete, playing
					both semi-pro baseball and golf, former professional musician, former personal trainer and strength
					coach, former music industry professional, and now software engineer, I know the meaning of
					discipline, but I also know I love learning!
					Previous to software engineering, my career in the music business started as a <strong>project
						manager</strong>, and
					ended up leading me to become a data analyst in <strong>Income Tracking Analytics</strong>.
					In that role, I worked regularly with large data in Hadoop then later utilizing cloud providers and
					services such as Google Cloud Platform, using visualization software like Tableau, and
					open-source SQL engines like Apache Hive and Impala, and writing scripts in python. I was also
					exposed to
					utilizing the underlying platform services and infrastructure using
					Kubernetes and Ansible, also wrote scripts to fetch data from various API's, and worked with
					developers to build
					tools for <strong>process automation and business forecasting</strong>.</p>

				<p>It was during this role that I started to teach myself programming, and immediately fell in love with
					it. So much so, that I went all in and decided to attend a bootcamp called <a
						href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" alt="NSS Link">Nashville Software School</a>. My
					focus
					there included Javascript, React, Node.js, Python, and the Django framework.
					This was a fairly substantial career shift, but one I am happy I made as I get to solve problems
					everyday, learn everyday, and keep my search for a challenge always satisfied!</p>

				<p>Currently, I am working as a <strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> where my day to day duties
					can range from
					optimizing existing infrastructure to support removing technical debt and preventing future
					incidents, tracking core metrics and solving bottlenecks proactively, building/ improving tools and
					features that refine or enhance sustainability, monitoring, and logging; as well as resolving
					incidents within internal SLAs, and am the lead for everything surrounding testing, test coverage,
					testing standards and testing best practices. I regularly use technologies like Terraform,
					Kubernetes,
					Helm, Jenkins, Docker, python, and Bash scripting, as well as tools like Sentry.io, New Relic, Snyk,
					Styra, Coveralls, SauceLabs, Divvy Cloud, and Codefresh. </p>

				<p>What lead me to becoming an SRE was my previous knowledge and interest of the entire development cycle and
					workflow, as well as passion and curiosity for infrastructure. Previous to my current role, I was a
					<strong>full-stack software engineer</strong>, where my day to day would range from front end work
					like creating an entirely <strong>new feature or page</strong>, or refining an existing one,
					<strong>manipulating and partitioning data, data visualizations</strong>, and much
					more. In addition, I worked on back end functionality like creating an ERD and wire framing to
					plan for a new feature/ migration/ API endpoint, implementing the specified database structure and API contract in models and
					views,
					adding or editing existing functionality in a controller (view if this is Django), <strong>building
						endpoints for a Flask API, refining back end validations, testing for site reliability and
						security</strong>, and everything in between like
					maintaining the CI/CD pipeline in deployment to a development environment and production, health
					checking our Kubernetes clusters, changing/ creating IAM permissions as needed, and
					<strong>maintaining and managing expectations</strong> of stakeholders through clear communication
					regarding sprint status,
					bandwidth, and feasibility of any particular goal.
				</p>

				<p>In addition, my previous professional experience in data visualizations using python and Tableau,
					utilization of Hadoop and later GCP, knowledge of income tracking <strong>reporting</strong>,
					<strong>recovery</strong>, and
					<strong>analytics</strong>, usage of SQL for queries using various drivers and <strong>Power
						BI</strong>, means I am well versed in
					many technologies, as well as a very quick learner.
				</p>

				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy being active, going to the gym, being involved in the community as well as
					going to conferences, and anything that involves learning something new or challenging myself. I
					also really enjoy <strong>mentoring</strong> new students and helping people bring out the best in
					themselves.</p>

				<h3>Volunteer Work</h3>
				<p>PyTennessee 2020</p>
				<p>PyTn is hosted at Nashville School of Law and is is a yearly regional Python conference that is a
					developer-focused Python conference with talk topics running the gamut between beginner and
					advanced, and from web development to data science and machine learning. I was responsible for
					possibly the most important part of the conference--giving the speakers the help they needed and
					keeping the conference moving smoothly. I participated in helping in set-up, tear down, checking
					guests in, and moving items as necessary.</p>
				<p>Music City Code 2019</p>
				<p>The Music City Tech conference is held at Nossi College of Art in Nashville, TN and is a conference
					that caters to developers and touches on all aspects of software and website development. The
					Conference is focused on quality over quantity, with three sub-conferences: Music City Code, Music
					City Agile, and Music City Data. As a volunteer, I was responsible for set-up before the conference
					and checking guests in, as well as catering to the speakers, making sure they had what they needed
					for their talks, getting them set up for their talks, as well as any duty necessary to make sure the
					conference ran as smoothly as possible.</p>
				<p>Dev Ops Days 2021</p>
				<p>Worked closely with community chair to to recruit speakers, volunteers, and visitors for the
					conference.</p>
