			<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
			<p>Before becoming a software engineer, I had been working in the Music Business for 5 years, being involved
				on the technical side doing project
				management, data analytics, and development. Before that, I was a semi-pro golfer, professional
				musician, and for a couple years a personal trainer and strength coach.</p>
			<br>

			<p>I am incredibly passionate about what I do, as I get to solve problems every day! During my time in the
				Music Business, I had the pleasure of
				working on a nationally recognized team for innovation and being on the cutting edge of technology in
				the Music Business.
				After the decision to sharpen my skills and attend Nashville Software School, I worked on small open
				source projects, picked up contract work, and then secured a position as a Full Stack Software Engineer
				at a startup in Nashville called <a href="https://www.rootnote.co/">RootNote</a>. This was a true full
				stack role, where I was responsible for architecting and building features, as well as testing, from the
				planning phase, to back end, to front end, and integrating all with our CI/CD pipeline and deployment
				infrastructure. My interest in DevOps, as well as expertise in both backend and frontend led me to my
				role which I currently hold, as a Site Reliability Engineer/ L2 Support Engineer at <a
					href="https://getbuilt.com/?utm_term=built%20technologies&utm_campaign=Company&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8929400305&hsa_cam=672683233&hsa_grp=34428080295&hsa_ad=216387600416&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-263662130765&hsa_kw=built%20technologies&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw28T8BRDbARIsAEOMBczQhIWD35YLeXvvljUlI2w_2M1Mv-46saDYETfYYG2Df-nG1fzMo-8aAokzEALw_wcB">Built
					Technologies</a>.
				Personality wise, I am a lifelong learner and will always consider myself "junior" as there is always
				something new
				to learn, something to improve, and goals to be met. I am self-motivated, productive, accomplished
				individual with a dedication to working towards ambitions. As
				an organized team member, I enjoy working with new people as well as established groups. I am a fast
				learner when it comes to new tasks with strong analytical, planning, and problem solving skills.</p>

							Quantum Coasters also

							API/ database of roller coaster information and locations, as well as being an interactive
							application where users can record their credits, see a live leaderboard, contribute to the
							app's database by adding roller coasters, and message other users in a chat / forum. This is
							a
							<strong>full-stack</strong> application with a React frontend and Django REST API on the
							backend. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used for authentication and

							role. In addition, Quantum Management provides a dashboard of analytical business
							intelligence information for educated business
							decisions, reporting, forecasting, and much more customizable queries to derive financial
							and
							income tracking data. All of which are displayed using data visualization tools for easy
							readability and analysis. For a more detailed ReadMe, click the Github link below!

			<h3 class="snippet-title">From project manager, to data analytics manager, to developer.</h3>
			<p>Most recently, as an Income Tracking Services Manager and Data Analyst at <a
					href="https://www.bmg.com/de/">Bertelsmann Music Group</a>, I gained experience working in a rapidly
				changing and demanding environment, where my role touched nearly every other department in the company.
				My responsibilities in redirection, live performance tracking, mechanical tracking, radio tracking,
				pipeline analysis and forecasting would contribute to over $5 million dollars recovered annually.
				In addition, I worked regularly with large data in Hadoop, utilized the underlying platform services and
				infrastructure, wrote scripts to fetch data using various API's, and worked directly with our developers
				to build tools, apps, and automate processes.
				My deepening curiosity and drive to always have something new to work towards lead me to attending <a
					href"http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" alt="NSS Link">Nashville Software School</a>. Currently, I
				am a full-stack software engineer at <a href="https://www.rootnote.co/">RootNote</a> where I get to help
				build many of analytical and data visualization software I once used. </p>
